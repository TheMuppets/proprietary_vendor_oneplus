    <!-- All the target related information goes in TargetInfo tag.
    Following are the supported fields for  TargetInfo tag.
        Mandatory Fields
        * NumClusters, number of clusters
        * TotalNumCores, total number of cores
        * SocIds, a comma seperated list of supported socids for this target.
        Other Fields
        * Target, target name.
        * SynCore, default value is "1" implies sync core and change to "0" for async core.
        * CoreCtlCpu, core_ctl is enabled on which physical core, defalut value is "-1".
        * MinCoreOnline, minimum number of cores needed to be online, default value is "0"
        * GovInstanceType, default value "0" which implies "CLUSTER_BASED_GOV_INSTANCE",
          can be changed to "1" for "SINGLE_GOV_INSTANCE".
        * CpufreqGov, default value is "0" which implies "INTERACTIVE", can be changed it
          to "1" for "SCHEDUTIL".

    <!-- For each cluster,write a seperate ClustersInfo tag.
        Following are the supported fields for ClustersInfo tag.
        Mandatory Fields
        * Id, cluster number starts with index 0.
        * NumCores, total number of cores for that cluster.
        Other Fields
        * Type, whther a "little" or "big" cluster.
        (Type is mandatory, If there is more than one cluster.)
        * MaxFrequency, Any limitations for max frequency for that cluster.

    <!-- For targets sharing the same platfrom, we can have seperate config tag for each
         of those targets with different number in the Config tag and basing on the socId
         of the target device, we decide which configs to consider. -->
